# ReadMe Oblig3 UN's 14th Goal
## Life Under Water

### Brainstorming 
In the first session we decided on the sustainable goal. We had a lot of good ideas for both the 14th and the 15th goal, but landed on goal 14.
Life below water. This goal fucus on sustainability and conserving of the oceans, seas and the marine resources. 
When deciding on what we wanted our storytelling to convey, we very quicly decided that we wanted.
We wanted to convey and tell a story about plastic pollution. We were all at the same page when talking about showing people what can happend with the 
plastic we are throwing away and not recycling.
The group had read about a plasticbag found all the way down at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, in the dark where no human has ever been before.  

### Story board
After the brainstorming we made a storyboard of the sections we wanted to include in the story.
The storyboard is showing the sections that our story is parted in. From the first part where Carlos, our guy, is comming out of a store with a plastic bag
to bottom of the ocean where the same plasticbag is found.

## Code
### JavaScript
We used Java Script (JS) for the intersection observer and the button that's turning the animations on/off for a more accessible webpage.

### HTML
In html we decided to split the main tag into sections. Every section is working like a canvas.
The sections is tagged and called in the JS with the intersection observer. The elements is showing when they comes in the viewport.
For the svg elements we decided to use the img tag for a shorter and more clean html code. 

### CSS
In the css code we decided to use as little as possible of the pixel value, and as much as possible of the view width (vw) for a 
easier scalable page. 
Bacuse we wanted the story to start on land with the sky and end up on the bottom of the ocean we decided that a linear-gradient background color was 
a good option. So the background goes from light blue to black. 
The elements are displayed with flex and positioned with position relative and absolute. 

### Animations
The elements are animated both inside the svg elements and in the css code. We are using @keyframes and SMIL animation. Our plasticbag is animated with SMIL.
